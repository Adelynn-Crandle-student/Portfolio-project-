    <p>Hey there! I'm a 17-year-old girl from Coopersville, Michigan, and you can usually find me knee-deep
        in either art or programmingâ€”or sometimes both at once! Art's been my thing since forever. There's just something
        about putting pencil to paper or brush to canvas that makes my heart sing. Whether I'm sketching my surroundings
        or experimenting with watercolors, it's my way of unwinding and expressing myself. But then there's programming.
        It's like this whole other world where I get to be a digital architect, building websites or tinkering with apps. 
        Sure, it can be frustrating when my code doesn't cooperate, but the thrill of problem-solving is worth it.</p>
